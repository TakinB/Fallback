 This is part of the prototype for Fallback project <br />
 This program is written for ESP8266. By uploading this code into your ESP8266, you will get an WiFi access point, which serves as a captive portal. It means upong clicking on the WiFi sign in page, you will get redirected to a customized website which is hosted on ESP8266 as well. The website is under the data folder. <br />

 *  Make sure all the html, font, and all fron end is in a folder called data <br />
 *  Make sure this sketch is in the same root as data <br />
 *  First upload this Arduino code to the ESP8266 <br />
 *  Then in Arduino IDE navigate to tools>ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload  <br />
 *  upload the data folder to ESP8266 <br />
 *  Make sure in the tools tab, you have the right flash size selected (4Mb) and size of OTA is more than the data folder size <br />
 *  For example I've chosen 4Mb and 1019Kb as the OTA in the tools>flash size <br />
